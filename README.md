## Useful links:

### [The vaRDas unofficial firmware flasher](https://mrekin.duckdns.org/flasher/)
vaRDas is kind enough to maintain a flasher with the latest releases of the firmware.

>[!NOTE]
>The official Meshtastic flasher now has the universal `TCXO-OPTIONAL` firmware. I'm still linking it here because this also has some custom implementations and languages.

### [Adafruit bootloader updates](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_nRF52_Bootloader/releases)
Find update-nice_nano_bootloader-0.9.x, and copy the uf2 across to your pro-micro.

### [Nice!Nano starting guide](https://nicekeyboards.com/docs/nice-nano/getting-started/)
Some useful information on the board that the Pro-Micro is "inspired by".

## Other peoples boards:
### WashTastic and Flushable - NRF52
https://github.com/valzzu/meshtastic-pcbs
* Impossible to summarise here - they have to be seen to be believed.
* Iris keeps these up to date with her testing of them as they're built.
* Variants using full modules, pro-micros and bare NRF chips.

### Fake-tec - NRF52840
https://github.com/gargomoma/fakeTec_pcb/
* Uses the same NRF52840 Pro-micro boards as my designs above
* An excellent design, using the outline of the Heltec v3 to take advantage of all the cases out there.
* Has a voltage divider built-in, with thru-hole or SMD resistors
* Can flush-mount the PCB to reduce height even further

### Cheapmesh - ESP32-C3
https://gitlab.com/paulhausk/CheapMesh/-/tree/main
* HT-CT62 based
* Multiple options to power & interface
* Initial issue has native USB d+/d- switched - check before building
* Has components on the underside that make it harder to assemble

### Econotastic - RP2040
https://sites.google.com/view/econotastic/home
* RP Pico (or clone) as MCU
* Uses RA-01SH, but can also use HT-RA62
* Changes in code not really required - see `TCXO_OPTIONAL`

### Mesh Heltec Tiny - ESP32-C3
https://oshwlab.com/vardas/meshheltectiny
* HT-CT62 based
* Pretty complete

### Ikoka nano
https://github.com/ndoo/ikoka-nano-meshtastic-device
* Uses NRF52 based Xiao board
* Uses a 30db radio module, 1W of power in a very small package

### Original Xiao BLE node
https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/blob/master/variants/xiao_ble/README.md
* Uses NRF52 based Xiao board
* Shows the basic pinout and procedures for making the basic node.
* The original!

### Faketec CO2
https://github.com/paulwalko/faketec-co2
* Extends the fake-tec design with a companion promicro to take additional readings and then send them over the mesh.
* This is the cleanest implementation of this that I have seen.

### Pro Meshro
https://github.com/hawkeyes0v0/pro-meshro
* Using the excellent Wio SX1262 from Seeeeeeeeeeed.
* Provides a JST PH 2.0mm connector mounting point for the battery.
